	<blockquote cite="https://www.perfectdogbreeds.com/blue-nose-pitbull/">
	In recent years, the Pitbull Terrier has gained a bad reputation, as they became popular for being used in dog fighting. Many people believe they are dangerous.
	
	However, for hundreds of years the American Pitbull Terrier was known as a “Nanny Dog” for their reliable temperament with small children and families. They are affectionate and loyal to those they know the most, they love to play and make the best family dogs.
